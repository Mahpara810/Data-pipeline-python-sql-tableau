cd Data-pipeline-python-sql-tableau
```
## 2. Set Up the Environment
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 3. Set Up SQL Server
•  Create a new database.

•  Run the SQL scripts in the sql/ folder to set up the necessary tables.

## 4. Load Sample Data
• Ensure the sample data is loaded. If not already included, insert the data manually.

## 5. Run ETL with Python
•  Update the database connection strings in the Python scripts as needed.

•  Execute the ETL script:
```bash
python python/etl_script.py
```
## 6. Open Tableau Dashboard
• Open the .twb or .twbx file from the tableau/ folder using Tableau.

• Connect to your SQL Server database or use the extracted data.

## 7. Explore the Dashboards!
Enjoy exploring the visualized data insights!
