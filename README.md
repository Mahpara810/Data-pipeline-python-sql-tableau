# Technologies Used
1. Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy/pyodbc) – for data extraction, transformation (ETL)

2. SQL Server – for data storage and querying

3. Tableau – for building interactive dashboards

4. Optional: Jupyter Notebook for EDA and testing
# Features
1. Automated ETL using Python

2. Cleaned and normalized data stored in SQL Server

3. Interactive dashboards in Tableau

4. Real-world dataset (customizable)

5. Modular codebase and reusable scripts

# How to Run

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mahpara810/Data-pipeline-python-sql-tableau
cd Data-pipeline-python-sql-tableau

1. Clone the Repository
   git clone https://github.com/Mahpara810/Data-pipeline-python-sql-tableau
   cd Data-pipeline-python-sql-tableau
2. Set up Environment
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set up SQL Server
Create a database and run the scripts in the sql/ folder to set up tables.

Load sample data if it's not already included.

4. Run ETL with Python
Update the connection strings in the Python scripts if needed.

Then run the ETL script:
python python/etl_script.py

5. Open Tableau Dashboard
1. Open the .twb or .twbx file from the tableau/ folder.

2. Connect to SQL Server or use the extracted data.

3. Explore the dashboards!
